# 2048

This project is licensed under the terms of the GNU v3.0 license.

This is 2048 (or at least my version of it), using an OOP focus. I am hoping to develop this project over time into a game with multiple different 'difficulties', or takes, on the original game, aswell as adding a reset button so that people can choose to play again without refreshing any local data. For example, I plan to add a (basic) personal bests leaderboard at some point, which will hold the data in local storage and then appear upon either resetting or starting/ending the game.


This project is one of my first times working properly with OOP, including things like private variables, getters and setters. Therefore, if the comments within the code seem very obvious, please take it with a pinch of salt as it is more for me as a learning process.
