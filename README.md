This is 2048 (or at least a version of it), using an OOP focus. I am hoping to develop this project over time into a game with multiple different 'difficulties', or takes, on the original game, aswell as adding a reset button so that people can choose to play again without refreshing any local data. For example, I plan to add a (basic) personal bests leaderboard at some point, which will hold the data in local storage and then appear upon either resetting or starting/ending the game.


This project is one of my first times working properly with OOP, including things like private variables, getters and setters. Therefore, if some of the comments within the code seem very obvious, or the code is inefficient in places, it is more for me as a learning process.

I am also aware that React would make this project a lot easier to write and read for both creator and user, but I wanted to show that I could use an OOP focus when creating projects.
Perhaps at some point in the future I might recreate this with React, but for now it will stay
written in JavaScript.
