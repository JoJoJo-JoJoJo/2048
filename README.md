# 2048

Credit to Web-Dev Simplified for the foundation of this game.

This is 2048 (or at least a version of it), using an OOP focus. There is a reset button/navbar which will reset the game without returning to the home screen. The home screen appears upon first loading the game with the title (2048) and "PLAY" text appearing, aswell as a selection of themes which change the colours of the tiles and home screen. Upon winning/losing the game, the home screen falls down from the top of the window into the centre of the screen, with the title being replaced by the text "YOU WIN!" or "YOU LOSE..." respectively. The text in the play button then also changes from "PLAY" to "PLAY AGAIN" (regardless of win/loss).

This project is one of my first times working properly with OOP, including things like private variables, getters and setters. Therefore, if some of the comments within the code seem very obvious, or the code is inefficient in places, it is more for me as a learning process.

I am also aware that React would make this project a lot easier to write and read for both creator and user, but I wanted to show that I could use an OOP focus when creating projects.
Perhaps at some point in the future I might recreate this with React, but for now it will stay
written in JavaScript.

The home screen is not fully responsive, but should only be misaligned when opening any browser/developer tools.
